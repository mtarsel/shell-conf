Configuration
-------------

Fork my repository. You'll need your own copy to use it effectively.

Simply replace the files in the subdirectories with your configuration files.
Then commit the changes and push it to your personal repo.

The vim directory is special. You can add other files to it, and it will be as
if you added to the .vim directory on your system.

Use
---
Configure using the instructions above.

Clone the repository. Run the install script in the root directory of the
repository. It will install all of your config files.

When you're done, run the uninstall script in the root directory of the repo.
The configuration is restored to normal. It's as if you were never there! You
can now delete the repository from the machine.
