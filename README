Update
------
In this version, you do not have to locate your configuration files, simply run
the 'create' program in the root directory of this project and it will copy your
configurations into the proper folders for installation later. If you do not
have Xmodmap or zsh created, this generates a dummy one with the examples I
provided in the proper directory. For example, in /zsh/ there is zshrc_example
but after you run create, it will be renamed into zshrc for installation.

Description
-----------
A set of scripts that let you use your own shell, vim, etc configuration on any
Linux machine without disturbing its configuration.

Configuration
-------------

Fork my repository. You'll need your own copy to use it effectively.

Simply replace the files in the subdirectories with your configuration files.
Then commit the changes and push it to your personal repo.

The vim directory is special. You can add other files to it, and it will be as
if you added to the .vim directory on your system.

Use
---
Configure using the instructions above.

Clone the repository. Run the install script in the root directory of the
repository. It will install all of your config files.

When you're done, run the uninstall script in the root directory of the repo.
The configuration is restored to normal. It's as if you were never there! You
can now delete the repository from the machine.
